# Browser Compatibility

Here we will talk about browser compatibility.  
Browser compatibility is ability of web apps to exhibits same behaviour on different browsers on either same or different platforms. 
  
The testing should be done in all possible scenarios mentioned below:
- Different browsers like chrome, firefox, safari, IE etc
  - on same Operating System
  - on different Operating Systems like Linux, Mac, Windows
- Different versions of same browser (at least last 3 browser verions should be tested)

Browser compatibility is prime aspects to consider as it will limit the audience to access the web app.
